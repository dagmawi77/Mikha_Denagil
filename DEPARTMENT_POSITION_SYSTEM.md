### 🗄️ Database Tables Created

**1. `departments`** - Organizational departments
- department_name, department_code
- parent_department_id (for hierarchy)
- head_member_id (department head from members)
- description, status

**2. `positions`** - Job positions/roles
- position_title, department_id
- position_level (Executive, Manager, Staff)
- responsibilities, status

**3. `member_positions`** - Member-position assignments
- member_id, position_id, department_id
- start_date, end_date
- is_current (active assignment)
- appointment_type (Elected, Appointed, Volunteer)

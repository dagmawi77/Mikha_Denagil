# Role Management System - Complete UI/UX Modernization

## ✅ Complete Overhaul - Professional RBAC Interface

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixed

**Error:** `'get_assigned_routes' is undefined`

        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM role_routes WHERE role_id = %s
    """, (role_id,))

    roles.append({
        'role_id': role_id,
        'role_name': row[1],
